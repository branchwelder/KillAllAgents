This paper uses an agent-based modelling approach to integrate geographic information about individuals to simulate the spread of contagious disease in an urban setting based on people's daily activities, movement, and geo-spatial interactions between people. The authors' goal was to create a model to show how disease spreads through a network of human interactions, and give people a better understanding of how this occurs in an urban environment. It would be particularly useful for running "what if" scenarios on potential outbreaks.

In this paper, the authors investigate a computational agent-based model do determine its accuracy in modeling the diffusion of molecules in a three-dimensional solution. They find that their model closely mimics the real behavior of these systems, and they go on to simulate the effects of molecular crowding on effective diffusion.
