Liliana Perez, Suzana Dragicevic, "An agent-based approach for modeling dynamics of contagious disease spread" International Journal of Health and Geophysics 2009 – Published 05 August 2009 Link: https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-072X-8-50 (Links to an external site.) 
This paper uses an agent-based modelling approach to integrate geographic information about individuals to simulate the spread of contagious disease in an urban setting based on people's daily activities, movement, and geo-spatial interactions between people. The authors' goal was to create a model to show how disease spreads through a network of human interactions, and give people a better understanding of how this occurs in an urban environment. It would be particularly useful for running "what if" scenarios on potential outbreaks.

Azimi, Jomali, Mofrad, “Accounting for Diffusion in Agent Based Models of Reaction-Diffusion Systems with Application to Cytoskeletal Diffusion” Downloaded from http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025306 (Links to an external site.) In this paper, the authors investigate a computational agent-based model do determine its accuracy in modeling the diffusion of molecules in a three-dimensional solution. They find that their model closely mimics the real behavior of these systems, and they go on to simulate the effects of molecular crowding on effective diffusion.

Andrew T. Crooks, Atesmachew B. Hailegiorgis, "An agent-based modeling approach applied to the spread of cholera" Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815214002515 In this paper, the concept of directly agent based modeling to a specific deisease is explored. The authors' approach will be useful to us when creating a model of a specific disease ourselves. It is especially intereting how they modeled the spread of cholera, which needs a less obvious approach than most diseases.
